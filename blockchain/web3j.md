# call contract method
Calling constant methods
Constant methods are those that read a value in a smart contract, and do not alter the state of the smart contract. These methods are available with the same method signature as the smart contract they were generated from:
Type result = contract.someMethod(<param1>, ...).send();

# query contract
Querying the state of a smart contract
This functionality is facilitated by the eth_call JSON-RPC call.

eth_call allows you to call a method on a smart contract to query a value. There is no transaction cost associated with this function, this is because it does not change the state of any smart contract methodâ€™s called, it simply returns the value from them:
```java
Function function = new Function<>(
             "functionName",
             Arrays.asList(new Type(value)),  // Solidity Types in smart contract functions
             Arrays.asList(new TypeReference<Type>() {}, ...));

String encodedFunction = FunctionEncoder.encode(function)
org.web3j.protocol.core.methods.response.EthCall response = web3j.ethCall(
             Transaction.createEthCallTransaction(<from>, contractAddress, encodedFunction),
             DefaultBlockParameterName.LATEST)
             .sendAsync().get();

List<Type> someTypes = FunctionReturnDecoder.decode(
             response.getValue(), function.getOutputParameters());
```
Note: If an invalid function call is made, or a null result is obtained, the return value will be an instance of Collections.emptyList()
